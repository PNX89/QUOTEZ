"""The doc-drift contract, generated.

THE CONTRACT ITSELF IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY. It lives beside the generator that wrote this
file, in the toolset these sixteen repositories share, and the copy here is the half that is
identical everywhere. This paragraph used to name a file that is not in the tree, which is the
exact defect this file exists to detect.

Every repository in this toolset makes checkable claims in its README on purpose, and a claim
that was true when written and is false now is worse than one never made: it reads as evidence
right up until somebody checks it, and those somebodies are interviewers.

This file carries the half of the contract that is identical everywhere, and asserts that the
other half is still implemented here. It is generated, so editing it is pointless: change the
manifest instead.
