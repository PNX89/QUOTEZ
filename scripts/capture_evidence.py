"""Capture the demo's real output and the numbers the Pages card states.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The card at pnx89.github.io/QUOTEZ shows the output of a real run and four
numbers about this repository. Both are committed, which means both can go stale. This writes
them from the source of truth in one step, and `tests/test_docs.py` fails when what is
committed stops matching a live run, so staleness is a red build rather than a quiet lie on a
public page.

WHAT IT WRITES.
    docs/evidence/demo.txt    stdout of the demo command, byte for byte
    docs/evidence/facts.json  test total, supported Python range, release tag, capture date

Every number comes from a command, never from a memory. The test total is collected by pytest
in a subprocess, the Python range is read out of the CI matrix, and the release is read from
git. Run it with:

    uv run python scripts/capture_evidence.py
